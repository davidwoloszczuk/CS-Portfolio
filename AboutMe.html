          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I’m [Your Name], a 20-year-old Computer Science student currently attending Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois, where I’m pursuing my passion for technology and athletics. Growing up just outside of Chicago with Polish parents, I’ve been fortunate to be immersed in both English and Polish languages, and I speak Polish fluently.
As a sophomore, I’m building a strong foundation in various programming languages and tools, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Java, and GitHub. Recently, I’ve been expanding my expertise in React.js and MySQL to develop more complex web applications. My goal is to continuously learn and adapt to the ever-evolving field of software development.
Alongside my academic journey, I’m also an athlete at Lewis University, specializing in the 110m hurdles and 400m hurdles. Being a part of the track team has taught me resilience, time management, and the importance of pushing my limits—skills that I apply to my academic and professional pursuits as well.
I’m excited to leverage my technical and athletic experiences to grow as a software engineer and contribute to innovative projects in the tech industry. Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about the projects I’ve worked on and my journey as a student-athlete!
